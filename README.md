# Intro to Programming in Python

Learning to write code was never this easy!

## Tutorial Description

This is a beginner's tutorial for introduction to programming in python, targeted for anyone looking to learn programming and python from scratch. I believe in learning with practice and thus have included several scripts and programs to individually explain basic and intermediate concepts. Moreover, a total of 8 PowerPoint Presentations are included which cover all basic programming concepts, so do refer to them when starting out.
